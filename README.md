# ON Replit
Orginally this was written for ruby 3.1.2 (see below) but Replit uses a very old version of ruby. So I copied over my files into the replit base framework since I would have had to move my files into an older version regardless. Here is a link to the replit framework I forked https://replit.com/@replit/Rails-legacy

# ON Computer

NOTE: I used the default ruby framework to start off the project "rails g scaffold items name"


For this project you will need ruby 3.1.2 and Rails 7.0.3 (you need to use the ruby 7 project the top level project is for replit) 


Navigate to the directory this project is in the terminal


cd /project/dir


type


rails s


# Other notes
I made modifications (rest are from the templates I used) in the following files

### app


-> controllers -> items_controller.rb


-> services -> all files


-> model -> item.rb


### db


-> migrate -> all files


-> schema.rb


### config 

-> routes.rb
