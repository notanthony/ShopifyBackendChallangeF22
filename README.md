# ON Replit
Replit uses a very old version of ruby and using nix to run rails was a headache. So I copied over my files into replit base framework since I would have had to move my files into an older version regardless. Here is a link to the replit framework I forked https://replit.com/@replit/Rails-legacy

# ON Computer

NOTE: I used the default ruby framework to start off the project "rails g scaffold items name"


For this project you will need ruby 3.1.2 and Rails 7.0.3 (you need to use the ruby 7 project the top level project is for replit) 


Navigate to the directory this project is in the terminal


cd /project/dir


type


rails s
